# Experiments

This file outlines how to run the experiments on Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu 22.04 on x86-64 machines. For the following experiments, custom versions of Iceberg 1.10, Delta Lake Kernel 4.0 and Raven were set up on a cluster of 4 nodes.

## Set up
On all nodes, download Open JDK 17

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
```

On the node that will run Catalog Service (Node 2) and the node that will run the Garbage Collector (Node 3), download the Raven repo to build Raven: 
```bash
cd <raven_path>/src/thirdparty
./install.sh
cd ../..
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```

On both nodes, create a config file for the systems. An example config.txt file is under catalogservice/. The configs are as follows:
* postgres.host : The host address of the Metadata Store (Postgres).
* postgres.user : Postgres user
* postgres.password : Postgres password
* postgres.dbname : Postgres database name
* postgres.connect_timeout : Postgres connect time out
* gc.epoch_period : Garbage collector epoch period in milliseconds.
* gc.num_file_task_ingestors : Number of workers that create file tasks in the garbage collector.
* gc.num_file_task_executors : Number of workers that execute file tasks in the garbage collector.
* gc.graph.path : The path of the RocksDB instance for graph store.
* gc.graph.create : Whether to create a new graph store.
* gc.graph.max_pages : The maximum size of page index for graph analytic engine.
* gc.graph.num_rc_workers : Number of workers that perform reference counting.
* gc.metrics_output : The output path of metrics (files deleted) for the garbage collector.
* grpc.num_workers : Number of workers for the gRPC server of the catalog service.
* grpc.server_address : The address of the gRPC server
* catalog.num_workers : Number of workers of the catalog service.
* aws.region : AWS region for S3.
* aws.access : AWS access key for S3.
* aws.secret : AWS secret key for S3.

On the node (Node 1) that will run Metadata Store, download Postgres and set up credentials:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib

sudo -i -u postgres psql

CREATE USER "anonuser" WITH PASSWORD 'anonuser';
CREATE DATABASE "anonuser" OWNER "anonuser";
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "anonuser" TO "anonuser";

\c anonuser

ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO "anonuser";
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO "anonuser";
```

Then, run <raven_path>/experiments/metadatastore/catalog.sql


On the last node (Node 4), clone Delta Lake and Iceberg, apply the git patches, and build:
```bash
git clone --branch branch-4.0 --single-branch git@github.com:delta-io/delta.git
cd delta
git checkout bf6b370
git apply <raven_path>/experiments/delta4.0.patch
./build/sbt gatherAllJars
cd ..

git clone --branch 1.10.x --single-branch git@github.com:apache/iceberg.git
cd iceberg
git checkout ccb8bc4
git apply <raven_path>/experiments/iceberg1.10.patch
./gradlew :iceberg-exp:installDist
cd ..
```

On the same node, set up an embedded Hive instance (Hive 3.1.3 and Hadoop 3.4.1) for Iceberg.
